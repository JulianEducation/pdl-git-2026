# PDL 2026/02

This repository is used to learn about `git` and `GitHub` in Columbia's February 18, 2026 PDL.

## Instructions

We're going to use this repository in order to explore working on a project simultaneously (i.e. you, many different students, will all collaborate on sending changes to this one repository).

In order to do that you'll have to follow some steps:

* *fork* this repository, which gives you your own copy of the *whole* repository that you are then allowed to make changes to

* find a repository on GitHub that's relevant to a hobby or interest of yours, add a file to this repository (name it whatever you want) and inside that file, add a link to the repository you found, and one sentence describing what it does

* make a branch in your forked copy of this repository

* commit your file / changes

* push them to GitHub in your forked copy of this repository

* submit a pull request to *my* (@Julian's) copy of the repository, which will allow me to merge in your changes

* once you do so, go find someone else's pull request, and leave a comment on that pull request with either a suggested improvement or just say "looks good to me" if it's already good!

* I'll merge your pull request
